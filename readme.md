* Here I have created a directory. Inside this directory I have created a project name surveyProject. Inside surveyProject, I created an app name surveyApp, a virtual environment venv, a text file name requirements.txt. A database file db.sqlite3 generated by default. Yoy should have installed python, pip in your system.

- To run this project, 
    -First you have to clone the ptoject.
    - Then go to surveyProject directory where requirements file is exist and run this command to install required packages.
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

- In every api, we added authetication. For the listing api you have to provide authentication token in the header and the survey details api, you have to provide username and password.
    - Before this, you have create a superuser and user token from the admin panel
